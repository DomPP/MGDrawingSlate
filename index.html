        <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>MGDrawingSlate is a simple, customizable, and easy-to-use UIView subclass that allows developers to easily embed a drawing view within their app. It is based on <a href="http://soulwithmobiletechnology.blogspot.com/2011/05/uibezierpath-tutorial-for-iphone-sdk-40.html">this tutorial</a> but includes several enhancements, and utilizes a UIBezierPath to create a smooth path that follows the user's finger movements on the drawing slate. This implementation allows for a great deal of customizability, allowing developers (and, by extension, users) to easily change the drawing color, thickness, etc. Download it and give it a try!</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Simply copy <code>MGDrawingSlate.h</code> and <code>MGDrawingSlate.m</code> to your project. Then, in the view controller in which you want to embed the drawing slate, add <code>import MGDrawingSlate.h</code>.</p>

<p>To create the MGDrawingSlate, use</p>

<pre><code>MGDrawingSlate *drawingSlate = [[MGDrawingSlate alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(x, y, width, height)];
[drawingSlate addToSubview];
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you would prefer to position and size the drawing slate in Interface Builder itself, just create a placeholder view. In your <code>viewDidLoad</code> method, get the frame of the placeholder view, remove it from the superview, and initialize the MGDrawingSlate with that frame instead.</p>

<p>In addition, you can do several other things with the the MGDrawingSlate, like clear it and export the drawing to the user's camera roll. See the included demo application and its source code for ways to implement these. </p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>Because the MGDrawingSlate uses a UIBezierPath, it offers a lot of customizability right out of the box. In addition, MGDrawingSlate includes methods that make it easier to customize frequently-modified properties of the drawing path, namely the color and the line weight. To change the color, use</p>

<pre><code>[drawingSlate changeColorTo:whateverUIColorYouWant];
</code></pre>

<p>and to change the line weight, use:</p>

<pre><code>[drawingSlate changeLineWeightTo:whateverIntegerYouWant];
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you can also change any properties of the drawing slate's <code>drawingPath</code> directly. Just use</p>

<pre><code>drawingSlate-&gt;drawingPath.propertyToChange = desiredValue;
</code></pre>

<p>See the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIBezierPath_class/Reference/Reference.html">UIBezierPath documentation</a> for more information on the properties you can change.</p>
