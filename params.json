This implementation allows for a great deal of customizability, allowing developers (and, by extension, users) to easily change the drawing color, thickness, etc. Download it and give it a try!\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nSimply copy ```MGDrawingSlate.h``` and ```MGDrawingSlate.m``` to your project. Then, in the view controller in which you want to embed the drawing slate, add ```import MGDrawingSlate.h```.\r\n\r\nTo create the MGDrawingSlate, use\r\n\r\n    MGDrawingSlate *drawingSlate = [[MGDrawingSlate alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(x, y, width, height)];\r\n    [drawingSlate addToSubview];\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you would prefer to position and size the drawing slate in Interface Builder itself, just create a placeholder view. In your ```viewDidLoad``` method, get the frame of the placeholder view, remove it from the superview, and initialize the MGDrawingSlate with that frame instead.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you can do several other things with the the MGDrawingSlate, like clear it and export the drawing to the user's camera roll. See the included demo application and its source code for ways to implement these. \r\n\r\n##Customization\r\nBecause the MGDrawingSlate uses a UIBezierPath, it offers a lot of customizability right out of the box. In addition, MGDrawingSlate includes methods that make it easier to customize frequently-modified properties of the drawing path, namely the color and the line weight. To change the color, use\r\n\r\n    [drawingSlate changeColorTo:whateverUIColorYouWant];\r\n\r\nand to change the line weight, use:\r\n\r\n    [drawingSlate changeLineWeightTo:whateverIntegerYouWant];\r\n\r\nOf course, you can also change any properties of the drawing slate's ```drawingPath``` directly. Just use\r\n\r\n    drawingSlate->drawingPath.propertyToChange = desiredValue;\r\n\r\nSee the [UIBezierPath documentation](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIBezierPath_class/Reference/Reference.html) for more information on the properties you can change.\r\n\r\n##License and Copyright\r\nMGDrawingSlate is open-source and is licensed under the MIT License.
